studies for finite element method, first target is 1D version.
in progress...

there are some prerequirements for FEM.

1. asymmetric sparse linear system solver
2. numerical integration(Gaussian quadrature, 2-points is enough for up to second order elements)
3. sort algorithm(Bubble sort is enough, not mandatry?)

so as the first step, implemented BiCGSTAB method for 1.
